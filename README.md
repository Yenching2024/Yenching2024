### Hi there 

This is a space for my various projects analyzing all things commodities.

The projects will be mostly market/price analysis, but also might include some international trade or hard commodity production (especially metals/minerals).
As with my academic interests, I've got a particular concentration on the East Asian/Chinese market.

Generally code with Python, using SQL for database access. Right now most comfortable using Scikit-Learn as far as ML goes, but excited to implement more ML packages soon.

Outside of more academics/work, I'm also a big baseball fan- so I'm hoping to do some data analysis on the plethora of baseball data.
